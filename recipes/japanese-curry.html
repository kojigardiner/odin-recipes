    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese curry (カレー, karē) is commonly served in three main forms: curry over rice (カレーライス, karē raisu), curry
        udon (curry over noodles), and curry bread (a curry-filled pastry). It is one of the most popular dishes in
        Japan. The very common "curry rice" is most often referred to simply as "curry" (カレー, karē).</p>
    <p>Along with the sauce, a wide variety of vegetables and meats are used to make Japanese curry. The basic
        vegetables are onions, carrots, and potatoes. Beef, pork, and chicken are the most popular meat choices. Katsu
        curry is a breaded deep-fried cutlet (tonkatsu; usually pork or chicken) with Japanese curry sauce.[2]</p>
