    <p>Green tea ice cream (抹茶アイスクリーム, Matcha aisu kurīmu) or matcha ice (抹茶アイス Matcha aisu) is an ice cream flavor
        popular in Japan and other parts of East Asia. Green tea ice cream is also sold in monaka form. It has been
        available in the United States since the late-1970s, primarily in Japanese restaurants and markets, but is
        currently moving into mainstream availability.[1]</p>
