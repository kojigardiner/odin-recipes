    <p>Bolognese sauce (UK: /ˌbɒləˈneɪz, -ˈnɛz/, US: /ˌboʊlənˈjeɪz, -ˈniz/;[1] known in Italian as ragù alla bolognese,
        pronounced [raˈɡu alla boloɲˈɲeːse, -eːze], ragù bolognese, or simply ragù) is a meat-based sauce in Italian
        cuisine, typical of the city of Bologna. It is customarily used to dress tagliatelle al ragù and to prepare
        lasagne
        alla bolognese.</p>
    <p>Genuine ragù alla bolognese is a slowly cooked meat-based sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques,
        including sweating, sautéing and braising. Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto of onion, celery and
        carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork. White
        wine,
        milk, and a small amount of tomato paste or tomatoes are added, and the dish is then gently simmered at length
        to
        produce a thick sauce.</p>
    <p>Outside Italy, the phrase "Bolognese sauce" is often used to refer to a tomato-based sauce to which minced meat
        has
        been added; such sauces typically bear little resemblance to the Italian ragù alla bolognese, being more similar
        in
        fact to the ragù alla napoletana from the tomato-rich south of the country. Although in Italy ragù alla
        bolognese is
        not used with spaghetti (but rather with flat pasta, like tagliatelle),[2][3][4] so-called "spaghetti bolognese"
        has
        become a popular dish in many other parts of the world.[where?]</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, celery, carrot, and 1 pinch
            salt; cook and stir until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir ground beef into vegetables; cook and stir until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
            Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until most of the milk
            has evaporated and the bottom of the pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high and pour in white wine; cook and stir until wine has mostly evaporated, about 5
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl; crush them with your hands until they resemble a chunky
            sauce. Pour tomato mixture into ground beef mixture; fill the tomato can with 2 cups water and stir into
            sauce. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours
            but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from the top of sauce if desired. Add more water if sauce is too
            thick. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.</li>
    </ol>
